## Stay #1 – Familiar Environment

People love habits. Having to learn and master something new is not what we like. Switching to a different interface can be a bit painful and bring some challenges – especially when you have a whole team working with the software. Sticking to what we know is just more comfortable.

## Stay #2 – Money spent

If you are a corporation with many users on Jira, you would have probably spent a lot of money on this solution already. If taking up the Jira Datacentre solution that costs over 40,000 USD is not an issue for your company, then there is no reason to change it.

## Stay #3 – Easy Migration

No data security guidelines requiring a server solution at all cost for your company? In that case, you can just simply migrate from Jira Server to Jira Cloud without a need to look for another server solution.

## Leave #1 – Need to Stay on Server

Some companies have special guidelines in regards to data protection which require data to be placed on a Server rather than a Cloud. However, switching to Jira Datacentre would cost you about 40,000 USD annually.
But if you're not big enough to afford it, and still need to remain on a server?
You don't have that many options then – at least it makes your decision process easier. One of your options is [Easy Project](https://www.easyproject.com/). Their team has experience migrating data from Jira, plus they offer server solution. They will provide an analysis of your needs and the migration and accommodate your requirements. The cool thing - the initial analysis is free of charge. Quite a good option, don’t you think?

## Leave #2 – Need Better Support

If you ever needed help from Atlassian, you might have found it's not that easy to get. Talking to a robot on their website (and any other support from Jira partners) makes the conversation ineffective. In the end, it can take days for you to find the answer to your question.
Spending money on software, you would expect to get the best customer service to go with it, right? And that’s why [Easy Project](https://www.easyproject.com/) comes up with its dedicated Support Team. You can reach them via various channels – chat, phone, email, etc. – no matter what your issue is.

## Leave #3 – Need A Better Solution Opportunity

Having been on the Jira server for years, you probably did not need to “shop” around and see what the market got to offer. While migrating to another server, you may find that other server solutions got more to offer. For example, why not managing your resources or finances in the same place as your projects? Migrate to [Easy Project](https://www.easyproject.com/) all-in-one Server Solution and make your company’s workflow even more efficient.

Hope these few points will help you in your decision-making process. Good luck with your projects!
